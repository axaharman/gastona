   <help>
      //
      //  Declare the main frame (application window) as well as all possible secondary windows that
      //  the application use or might use. Usually frames has to declare also a layout except if the
      //  frame contains just one widget, in this case the same name can be used for the frame and
      //  the widget.
      //
      //  Syntax:
      //
      //    <frames>
      //       frameName, title, defaultWidth, defaultHeight
      //       ...
      //
      //  The frame at the first row is the main application window and it is shown by default while
      //  the rest has to be made visible explicitly (e.g. using the message "frameName show", see
      //  widget zFrame).
      //
      //  When the frame is built it takes a calculated size acording with some values like preferred
      //  size of the contained widgets, its data etc. This size might result convenient in many cases
      //  but it will not match always with what we would like, then can be adjusted with defaultWidth
      //  and/or defaultHeight. However, the frame as a widget has also attributes for its size (sizeX
      //  and sizeY) these values if given will overwrite the default values. For example, the user
      //  resize the frame, on closing the application this values are save and on loading the application
      //  the values are loaded. This can be achieved very easily, see listix command DUMP and LOAD.
